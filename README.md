# Youtube MP3 Downloader
A python module to take YouTube videos and convert to MP3. This is a wrapper function to download multiple MP3 files. 

## Preparing your data
The data needs to be a CSV file. The CSV file attached will serve as a good example of how it should be structured. There are two ways to run this:
1. The first way is via the download_mp3s.py script - this will expect a CSV and you need to pass the relevant parameters to the function contained therein
2. Download MP3s via the command line. I have included an argument parser for this purpose.

## Using the argument parser
